 #Ideas
 Iberian_Economic_Nightmare:0 "이베리아 경제의 악몽"
 Iberian_Economic_Nightmare_desc:0 "Despite being a fairly wealthy nation, Iberia is unable to make use of this economic power, due to its structure making taxation an absolute nightmare. With three jurisdictions constantly fighting each other for funding, and a massive money sink in the form of the Gibraltar Dam and the African colonization projects, the amount of money the government can actually make use of is fairly small. In order to get its economic situation together, the government will have to either force Portugal and Spain to work together to create a functioning Federal tax code, explore alternate routes of funding, or just ignore the problem and hope natural economic growth will compensate for the current shortfall in funding."

 Iberian_Economic_Bubble_2:0 "이베리아 경제 버블"
Iberian_Economic_Bubble_2_desc:0 "An unprecedented effect of the implementation of the autarkic system is the creation of a massive bubble. Prices for certain goods have inflated severely, and economists are uncertain if this economic bubble will expand further and sustain itself. We must act quickly, for if it were to pop, Iberia will be hit with an economic crisis two times more devastating than its predecessor."

 Iberian_Economic_Miracle:0 "이베리아의 경제 기적" 
 Iberian_Economic_Miracle_desc:0 "For years, the Iberian peninsula has been dealing with an economic crisis that affected its ability to develop and prosper as a nation. Many people laid homeless on the streets while many of the industry held on by bare subsidized threads. However, since the intervention of the Caudillos and the government, who have changed their policy from mere band-aiding to full intervention, alongside advice from several technocratic ministers, the Iberian economy has recovered at a staggering pace. Its GDP has been skyrocketing, alongside the reduction of unemployment numbers to a near minimum.\n\n§GAll in all, life has turned for the better in Iberia.§!"

 Return_to_Autarky:0 "Return to Autarky" 
 Return_to_Autarky_desc:0 "With the economic crisis still raging on, the government has decided to make a return to the old state policy of economic autarky, in which Iberia will develop a self-sustaining and independent national economy built on the basis of corporatist organization and heavy state intervention into the economic sphere. Originally abandoned in the 1950's in favour of a more modern and liberal approach to economic development, under the influence of the older Falangist organizations the Caudillos have chosen to make a return to economic autarky and other traditional economic policies. While the shift back to the old system is causing economic problems, the Caudillos economic advisors believe that it will be only a matter of time before the Iberian economy will be revitalized. "

 Optimised_Autarky:0 "Optimised Autarky" 
 Optimised_Autarky_desc:0 "With the policies of initial stages of Autarky approved and in operation, the economy has experienced small shifts in its growth. If we want to see the positive effects reveal itself fully, we must keep the momentum and continue to pass more autarkic laws."

 Iberian_Economic_Bubble_1:0 "이베리아 경제 버블"
 Iberian_Economic_Bubble_1_desc:0 "An unprecedented effect of the implementation of the autarkic system is the creation of a massive bubble. Prices for certain goods have inflated severely, and economists are uncertain if this economic bubble will expand further and sustain itself. We must act quickly, for if it were to pop, Iberia will be hit with an economic crisis two times more devastating than its predecessor."

 Council_Dissolved:0 "Council Dissolved!" 
 Council_Dissolved_desc:0 "By the orders of the influential Caudillos, the Iberian Council is to be dissolved. However, this news comes as a surprise to many, who've seen the council as a way to bridge the gap between the various peoples of Iberia, give equal representation for all parties, and successfully approve or disapprove of laws, all while avoiding the messy legislative and bureaucratic problems of the prior system. Many politicians have voiced their concerns and many are in favor of reestablishing it, but the Caudillos assure that measures are being implemented to smoothly transition. They estimate that in a few week's time, the outrage will have petered out and normality will ensue once more."

 New_Fundamental_Laws:0 "The New Fundamental Laws" 
 New_Fundamental_Laws_desc:0 "With the abolishment of the council, the Caudillos have approved of a new set of Fundamental Laws. These laws will allow the Caudillos to solidify their grasp over the government, and by extension, the entire country. While many are skeptical of this, the Caudillos have once again guaranteed the people by pledging to quickly bring stability and prosperity back to Iberia.\n\n§ROnce time will tell if they succeed.§!"

 IBR_unequal_development:0 "Unchecked Developmentalism"
 IBR_expanded_counterintelligence:0 "Expanded Counterintelligence"
 IBR_regional_faction_buff:0 "Regionalist Spirit"

 The_Gibraltar_Dam:0 "지브롤터 댐"
 The_Gibraltar_Dam_desc:0 "Nearly the hour after the Dam for the 'ambitious,' if not completely insane, German plan to drain the Mediterranean was finished, the German economy failed. With the Germans leaving the dam as a failed project, the Iberian overseers noted the numerous failings in the walls and locks. Within the next few days the threat to the lives of millions of people on the coasts of the Mediterranean became clear. Now Iberia must pick up the slack where "The Greatest Empire of Europe" has most obviously failed."
 
 IBR_The_Gibraltar_Dam_Abandoned:0 "The Gibraltar Dam - Maintenance Ended"
 IBR_The_Gibraltar_Dam_Abandoned_desc:0 "Due to budgetary limitations, the Iberian Union has officially ceased all operations with the goal of keeping the dam more than essentially stable. The only actions that are to be carried out are low-level maintenance, structural surveys, and essential repairs. Now, with resumption of intensive maintenance operations being impossible due to economic reasons, Iberia can finally rest assured that the budget for fixing the dam will no longer be a constant source of pain for the economy."

 The_Gibraltar_Dam_Completed:0 "완공된 지브롤터 댐" 
 The_Gibraltar_Dam_Completed_desc:0 "The Gibraltar Dam was once a monument to the hubris of the Reich, the so-called "Greatest Empire of Europe." A mere husk of steel and concrete.\n\nNo longer. Now the Gibraltar Dam stands tall as a testament to the strength and ability of the Iberian people. It shall produce enough electricity to power half a continent, and allow rail and roads to link together Europe and Africa as a newly expanded network of locks let shipping flow unhindered through the straits of Hercules. Tourists and citizens alike flock to Gibraltar and Tangiers to view the dam in all its glory.\n\nA symbol of failure, transformed into a new world wonder."

 Betray_Old_Guard:0 "Betrayal of the Old Guard"
 Betray_Old_Guard_desc:0 "While both Franco and Salazar may seem like a pair of strongmen who steer the nation all by themselves, this couldn't be farther from the truth. Both men lie at the top of an intricate web of alliances, factions, ideologies and interests that decided to elevate them to their current positions. They both previously enjoyed great loyalty from their allies, but the creation of Iberia slowly and steadily ended their universal popularity.\n\nWithout the prospect of a possible restoration, monarchists from both nations promptly abandoned their silent collaboration and many have even left the country. Hardcore nationalists from Spain and Portugal now accuse the Caudillos of treason, and rumors abound of coups attempts by hardliners in the regime, which were put down before news of them even left the offices of the government. Even the Catholic Church and the Armed Forces, the two strongest pillars of the system, have begun quietly complaining. With this situation, the Caudillos now sit almost alone, holding onto anyone that shows the slightest sign of loyalty; but ultimately betrayed by their allies, isolated by their own decisions."

 Disorderly_Federal_Army:0 "무질서한 연방군"
 Disorderly_Federal_Army_desc:0 "While the Spanish Army, Guardia Civil, and Portuguese Army all still exist in a limited capacity, the Iberian Army is regarded rightfully as an unholy mess. Clashing doctrines and methods of operation, no standardization, a lack of decisive funding, and very little capacity for the Iberian federal government to actually make a decision absolutely hamstrings the Army. While the Spanish and Portuguese armies, in case of invasion, could be able to put up a decent fight, putting either under federal control is likely to strain the Union to its breaking point."

 Disorderly_Federal_Army_Heydrich:0 "공황 상태의 육군 개혁"
 Disorderly_Federal_Army_Heydrich_desc:0 "While both the Spanish Army, Guardia Civil, and Portuguese Army still exist in a limited capacity, the Iberian Army is regarded rightfully as an unholy mess. Clashing doctrines and methods of operation, no standardization, a lack of decisive funding, and very little capacity for the Iberian federal government to actually make a decision absolutely hamstrings the Army. While the Spanish and Portuguese armies, in case of invasion, could be able to put up a decent fight, putting either under federal control is likely to strain the Union to its breaking point. This situation has been addressed, partially, due to the panic following Heydrich becoming Führer of Germany, but the underlying issues remain."
 
 Separatist_Tensions:0 "Separatist Tensions"
 Separatist_Tensions_desc:0 "Although the harsh measures taken by the Spanish government to crush Basque, Galician, and Catalan nationalism are still in effect, the risk of renewed secession movements still exist. In the event of a crisis befalling the Union, regional separatist tensions could flare up and immediately make the situation much, much worse. Additionally, there is a strong suspicion that many particularly extreme rebel groups are German-funded, opening up a strong risk of them having capabilities that the government does not necessarily know about."
 
 The_Iberian_Council_1:0 "The Iberian Council" 
 The_Iberian_Council_1_desc:0 "Founded several years back to assist in governing efforts and help stabilize the shaky situation of Iberia at the time, the Iberian Council has just been given near absolute power over the entire nation. While many had feared it would use this newfound power to exert total control over the populace, they have exercised their power to transform Iberia, striving to emulate the true democracies such as the United States of America.\n\n§BBy the Council's hands, Democracy shall return to Iberia once more.§!"

 Crippled_Sovereignty:0 "Crippled Sovereignty"
 Crippled_Sovereignty_desc:0 "The Union is perfectly equal. In fact, it is mandated to be so. This has caused significant issues in actually achieving anything beyond the bare minimum of keeping civilization running. Any diplomatic action with the Union requires equal Portuguese and Spanish representation, and both countries have equal veto powers. The fact that this enables the Portuguese government to veto road construction in Barcelona was not thought of during the initial meetings..."

 Crippled_Sovereignty_notsomuch:0 "Weakened Sovereignty"
 Crippled_Sovereignty_notsomuch_desc:0 "The Union is an equal project between two nations, and was always mandated to be so. Any diplomatic action within the Union required equal Portuguese and Spanish representation, and both countries had equal veto powers. This had caused major issues in achieving political goals, but recent reforms have alleviated the worst issues of the political system."

 The_Dying_Triumvirate:0 "The Dying Triumvirate"
 The_Dying_Triumvirate_desc:0 "The Iberian Union's anger at the Triumvirate for not doing more to subsidize the maintenance of the Gibraltar Dam has lead to vast tensions between it and other members of the Triumvirate. Additionally, the problem of border clashes with Italy in Algeria has hugely escalated tensions as of late. If a compromise is not found quickly, it is likely that the Triumvirate will fall apart due to Iberian discontent."
 
 IBR_liberalisation:0 "Liberalization"
 IBR_liberalisation_desc:0 "As the democratization process is underway, the Iberian political structure is being liberalized, as the government's end goals include changing the system to that of a democratic one."
 
 Mediterranean_Tech_Exchange:0 "Mediterranean Military Technology Exchange Program"
 Mediterranean_Tech_Exchange_desc:0 "In order to facilitate faster military development, a technological exchange program has been established. Countries surrounding the Mediterrean sea will be participating, trading equipment such as simple firearms to more advanced mechanized vehicles with one another. With this program, every nation involved can hopefully create new material to equip their armies with."
 
 Dissolving_Iberian_Union:0 "이베리아 해체" 
 Dissolving_Iberian_Union_desc:0 "In order to avoid the possibility of a major crisis, the Iberian government has decided that the Iberian nation as many know it will be dissolved permanently. Many have said their grievances and some even protest, but the executive decision has already been approved. That being said, the administration will ensure the dissolution will be seamless and efficient. Once complete, the peninsula shall be divided into two, with Spain on the right, and Portugal on the left.\n\n§WThe Union that held out for two decades is now finally coming to an end.§!"

 Severing_Economic_Ties:0 "Severing Economic Ties" 
 Severing_Economic_Ties_desc:0 "As part of the Iberian dissolution efforts, the economic ties binding Spain and Portugal together will be severed. This is done in order to prevent another economic crisis in the foreseeable future."

 Severing_Military_Ties:0 "Severing Military Ties" 
 Severing_Military_Ties_desc:0 "As part of the Iberian dissolution efforts, the Federal Armed Forces containing both Portguese and Spanish troops will be abolished, and that the old Portuguese and Spanish Armed Forces shall be recreated as fully independent organizations in their respective countries."

 Dissolved_Federal_Government:0 "해체된 연방 정부" 
 Dissolved_Federal_Government_desc:0 "The final part of the Iberian dissolution is the abolishment of the federal government itself. The old administration is finally being dissolved, and the many bureaucrats and ministers who've held positions are receiving accommodations to compensate. While the last step has been made, the only thing holding back the official split of Iberia is the lack of recognition of the federal government's closure from both Spain and Portugal."
 
 IBR_State_Exemplary:0 "State Of The Union - Exemplary" 
 IBR_State_Exemplary_desc:0 "The Iberian Union and its people can rejoice, for they are the shining example of national stability in Europe, or perhaps even the whole world.

A tradition of the Iberian administration, this way the government makes sure that the desired effects are seen over the course of the coming year. Usually a rather mundane matter, this year's colonial budget has surprisingly received some criticism, with some within the government arguing that the state should first focus on the troubles faced by Iberians, particularly during this period of Christian celebration between Christmas and Easter. But such critics are a minority within the regime, and this year's colonial budget will go ahead as it always does.\n\nThis year's budget is bigger than usual, with great changes coming to Morocco and the Sub-Saharan colonies and a greater involvement on the development of Algeria by peninsular government."

 IBR_Business_Morocco:0 "모로코 사업"
 IBR_Business_Morocco_desc:0 "Considered the jewel of the colonial empire by Franco and most of the Spanish generals, Morocco is by far the most developed colony that Iberia possesses. With its humble beginnings as the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco, which only controlled a sliver of territory in the north and a couple of enclaves in the east, the colony was expanded immensely with the annexation of the French Protectorate at the close of the Second World War. Since then the colony has seen a great number of businesses and settlers flock to it to exploit its riches. As such, we must ensure that Morocco stands strong and keeps creating revenue for the nation."

The convoys and containers that come here just keeps increasing with time and there has already been a number of times where port authorities had to redirect vessels to secondary ports because Ifni was at full capacity.\n\nAs a key element in the Moroccan economy, the government has decided to greatly expand the port to allow more ships in and, therefore, increase the quantity of trade that flows into the region. The military naval base will also be expanded, although not as much as its civilian partner, for a better defense of the region."

To this day it is the first line of defense against any possible invaders that may strike the colonies first and is also in charge of keeping peace in our territories beyond Gibraltar. As such, it should be well equipped at all times. While it has been lacking in the last few years due to budget mismanagement, the colonial officers will be happy to hear their boys are getting some brand new toys, just as good as those the peninsular troops use."

That's why they are suggesting the allowance the government gives to the Moroccan king is revisited and curtailed to decrease the powers of the monarch, whether it's through a smaller quantity of money or a stronger grip on his influence."

With the chaos in the French colonies that followed the end of the Second World War, both Italian and Iberian troops rushed in to secure Algeria. Although it was clear that both countries wanted the colony for themselves, the French never officially handed authority over to them, as they believed Algeria was as integral to France as Paris was. However, with the military restrictions imposed on France by the Germans, it was unable to properly claim anything outside of Algiers.\n\nYet despite not allowing the French to defend their colony, the Germans also continued to recognize their claim to it. With France now a loyal German puppet state, neither Rome nor Madrid dared to claim Algeria as theirs. Instead they each began to send settlers into the areas of influences both countries had in the region to begin building a proper claim over the territory.\n\nThe Iberian settlers have been neglected for a long time now due to the government having more important matters to attend to, but with Italy on the move, it is time to properly develop and strengthen our area of control in Algeria."

Most of them travel through the Moroccan portion of the Sahara without much infrastructure or directions and many of them never make it to the end, instead being devoured by the sand and the dunes.\n\nTo counter this, a series of roads will be built and signs will be installed to help the settlers find the way to their new homes. The whole operation will be concealed as a simple expansion of the Moroccan road network in the region to not raise French suspicions."

Buildings where families share a bunk bed and restrooms are used by dozens of people are very common. Worst of all, a lot of settlers aren't able to find a job and they rely on ration cards to survive.\n\nSince the area is undeveloped and the government can't provide jobs, the local authorities will now be able to expand the quality and quantity of ration cards that are distributed among the settlers.

Sadly, these colonies are very undeveloped, with the government's attention focused on possessions closer to home in the deserts of North Africa. However, the latest reports show that Iberia's colonies to the South show quite an economic potential, with the climate in the Guineas perfect for agriculture and the several archipelagos possible sites for trade hubs.\n\nAs such, a considerable amount of money has been reserved for the development of these region with the hopes of them becoming yet another prosperous part of Iberia in the future."

Settlements are scarce, infrastructure is poor, and worst of all; bandits are a common occurrence. Natives that didn't accept Iberian rule when the area was pacified in the 50's regularly raid any town or village they find, no matter who inhabits it.\n\nMauritania has valuable minerals underneath it and their extraction would create jobs and wealth for the region, but with the bandits running around, no serious attempt at mining has been tried. If we want to develop the region and obtain its riches, the first step is sending more troops and building more military infrastructure down there to fight those that work against us."

These islands have a very small population and are mostly agrarian, therefore the attention they have received from the central government is almost non-existent. Infrastructure is weak and they depend on the transport convoys that regularly tour them to give them supplies like medicines or machines. These convoys apparently don't visit the islands with enough frequency as there have been several angry letters from the governors there asking for more frequent supply deliveries. To alleviate this, convoy visits will be made twice a month. Not only that, but bigger ports will be built in the islands to better integrate them into the country, with frequent civilian transport ships doing the trip between these archipelagos and the Peninsula."

To further try to convince us to accept, they have pledged to do all the necessary work to clean up the dense jungle there, create the necessary infrastructure to transport the goods and run the orchards; so that the government would only see profit.\n\nWhile it seems this plan is perfect, the people behind it are infamous in the high circles of Iberian society for having frequent contacts with Siegfried Müller, the Reichskommissar of Zentralafrika. Zentralafrika has been revealed to submit the natives to a state of near slavery when working in their plantations, but this won't happen in Guiné, right?"

However, just like the rest of the southern part of the empire, the state that Equatorial Guinea is in could be much better. While the colony is relatively developed and urban, it lacks proper electrical infrastructure throughout most of its territory.

In the face of German economic collapse, and, thus, a decline in the Teutons' ability to enact Machtpolitik, this call has lost its power, and all that remained was unresolved tension between the members of the Triumvirate.\n\nIdeology and imperial ambitions tore at the seams of alliance but it was really the lack of unified purpose that kept Iberia, Turkey and Italy together."

Our fraught recent history has taught us that we simply cannot trust those who claim to have the same interests as us.

Following the unification of the peninsula and the formation of the Triumvirate, a number of Italian military missions were sent to Iberia in order to help in modernising the fledgling Iberian army and organizing better communication channels for future allied operations.\n\nHowever, now that the anti-German alliance has been broken and relations are at a low point, there seems to be no more reason to keep the missions in the country. We should move to expel the foreign military personnel lest they begin to parse back sensitive information to the Italian state.

Following the collapse of the alliance, many have returned back to their nations of origins as tensions rose. Some, however, have not taken this step, choosing instead to remain on the peninsula. As much as we have appreciated their contributions to our society, we cannot take their presence lightly anymore. There can only be two reasons for their continued living in Iberia: naturalization or spying. Due to it being difficult to distinguish between the reasons on the surface, we must put all of these immigrants under watch to test their loyalty. There cannot be any possibility that they can do damage to Iberian state."

Having sensitive data fall into the hands of our new enemies could be just as dangerous now as if the Germans gained access to it.

Now however we stand at odds with our former ally. This has threatened the security of our investments as colonial governors or even the Italian government itself could move to nationalise our precious capital.

In order to protect them from outside influence and internal instability, a number of unified military missions were sent across the empires.\n\nIn these days we can no longer justify the stationing of our troops in Italian and Turkish territory.

We have no information on how the other former alliance members will treat those who in their eyes could be potential spies. Equally terrible would be their use against us whether in economic terms or to spread seditious lies.

Turkey has threatened to use direct military force to seize the lands it claims to be rightfully part of its nation. Italy has vowed to resist the aggressive invaders, invoking comparisons to German diplomatic tact.\n\nOur choice on whether we should get involved has been decided. We need to support the Turkish invasion in order to greatly weaken the Italian empire. This could mean that in the near future we may be able to assert our own claims on disputed land.

Were we to intervene on the Turkish side, or to withhold entirely, we may be able to benefit off of Italy's weakness...However, with the vitriolic rhetoric and aggression that the Turkish state has shown, we cannot, with good conscience, support them either through benign neglect or intervention. Hence, instead, we should seek to indirectly support the cause of the Italians who still hold the internationally recognized legitimate mandate over the territory.

Many visits to the continent that we brought great classical civilization to will have to be planned. The Latin American countries of Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and maybe even Cuba hold great potential for this plan. As secondary powers in their own right, we would be able to forge strong economic and military ties if our diplomacy is successful.

Despite their membership of the hated Unity-Pakt, we can play on the cultural and religious ties which Germany in its megalomania and cowardice in the face of Burgundy is quashing.

Romania fared little better. Yet the animosity created by territorial disputes and a bitter rivalry leaves the two nations weak and too divided to stand against possible future German encroachment.

The country has seen tremendous economic growth with the discovery of large oil deposits, which have made it a target of many diplomatic missions. We should also move quickly to build up our own relations with the aristocracy of the shifting sands and sprouting oil.

It has hence been decided that we should seek to meet representatives from both the National Indian government and the competing Azad Hind. Both states lay claim to be the legitimate ruling force in India which has created a tense rivalry we might be able to make use of. Officially, we have not recognized either government; therefore, we could seek to maximise potential gains by ascertaining which of the regimes will be a better partner in the future."

Following their immense success and tiresome imperial consolidation, the two former co-belligerents, however, grew apart in their ambitions. This has caused a considerable strain in their relations. It would be foolish to not make use of such a great opportunity.\n\nWe, therefore, should look to visit the Eastern Hegemon and some of their more important puppet regimes such as the Chinese.

In this, we have proven that our great Union is ready for business and closer ties to many nations around the world.\n\nThis has proven that the Triumvirate collapse was a blessing in disguise; as much as the anti-German bloc was necessary following the intense Hitlerite power plays, there are many more opportunities in the international sphere that we are now able to make use of.

There are many issues which still require attention due to the hurried unification of Portugal and Spain into Iberia. At the end of this, however, we will stand proud again, this time not shoulder to shoulder with the fellow Mediterranean countries but alone. In this way we will prove the worth of our nation without relying on others, a greater boon to our prestige. "

Turkey had only recently consolidated itself into a formal nation-state following opportunistic diplomatic actions, why should they have dropped such a practice so soon? The Italians on the other hand significantly betrayed their German allies twice in a single century. Reckless irredentism and overblown ambition had determined their mode of action in the international sphere for the duration of its rather short history.\n\nWe Iberians, on the other hand, have long traditions of statehood and acceptable diplomatic actions. It was not our fault that the fools abandoned the mutually beneficial anti-German alliance. The lesson learnt, however, was almost equally beneficial. The clarity by which we cannot afford to blindly trust other nations anymore is blinding. Instead we shall pursue a diplomatic policy of healthy skepticism. Foreign influences will have to prove that they are well intentioned."

However, it is equally true that being entirely isolated from the international sphere can have very dire consequences. The need to maintain trade ties and finding new ones is paramount for not damaging our economy. Equally important is the acquisition of intel on international politicking and alliance building. We absolutely cannot find ourselves alone and unprepared if the Germans resurge or other powers decide to intervene in Iberian affairs.

We must underline that we are a unified nation of Iberians. No longer are we simply citizens of Portugal or Spain, with separate identities and heritage.

Both men have hence developed a good image in the eyes of the majority of the Iberian people. This image has been used to create an effective cult of personality that critics say mirrors the reprehensible ways in which the Germans idolised their Führer. What that slander does not mention is that Iberia's Caudillos do not have to rely on distorting propaganda, as they have entirely proven their worth as leaders.

In the same vein as the Germans had laid their eyes on former Portuguese holdings in Mozambique and Angola, we have gained information that our remaining colonies are being targeted.

Galician terrorists nearly killed our beloved Caudillos, a tragedy that would have surely torn apart the union. This disaster has shocked the Caudillos into action, and made them realise that a more stable, long term system of government must be established.\n\nAs such, an Iberian Council has been devised, serving as a tool to deal with regional conflicts and help the various states reach agreements, instead of getting bogged down in the endless bureaucratic quagmire that was the former system.

A new question has come up recently as to a potential addendum to this rule:\n\nNatives from our African holdings do not count as citizens. Therefore, they have limited rights and are not eligible for many privileges that a regular citizen would have.

While it is difficult to introduce these values at a mass scale, an important step towards such an outcome would be to emphasize them in the constitution.\n\nFirst and foremost, parties with significant disputes should not turn to violence. We must pound this into their heads, at every turn, to prevent another Battle of Barcelona. We need to encourage these groups to work with the state, rather than fight it. After all, it is much easier to create change within the system rather than trying to overturn it."

For Iberia's stability, we cannot allow anything of the sort to come to exist. The best way to discourage the idea is to enshrine the opposite in the constitution.\n\nWe must explicitly denounce class struggle for what it is - pointless division and conflict. Every class must recall that they are Iberians, and that in the end they are of the same country, and so share a common destiny. They must collaborate with one another, so that the state works as well as possible."

So, we released the changes to the public, allowing them to see what we were planning in the new revision of the constitution. Once it had been dispersed properly, we took a survey to gauge public opinion.\n\nWith the results all in, we have mostly gotten exactly what we desired. True, there are no people in the streets screaming our names in almost religious praise, but that is acceptable. The survey shows that the people of Iberia are pleased with our changes. It is not as great as we had hoped, but it is a great occurrence nonetheless."

We have not collapsed into anarchy or seen the Union sundered yet, but that is more a result of dumb luck than our own competence. Who would want a country to run like this?\n\nWe need to give our administration a good, hard, look. We need to cut the slack, fix the problems, and straighten out a deeply crooked government. Right now, it's no wonder there was a Battle of Barcelona! We are lucky, in fact, that something like this had not happened sooner. It's time for some serious, structural reforms, starting with our constitution."

 IBR_Diarchy_Question:0 "The Diarchy Question"
 IBR_Diarchy_Question_desc:0 "When Iberia was first created, both Caudillos had to make a few compromises. Specifically, a few compromises with each other. For all their advantages, one could not top the other, nor did they want to in the face of a seemingly imminent German invasion. It seemed like an oxymoron, a riddle you would use to puzzle someone - how do you have two people with total power, heading the same state? It took much effort, but something was eventually devised.\n\nIt has been a long time since then. The times have changed, and with it the world, and the diarchy will likely need some changes as well. Neither Caudillo would lose their power, that could never happen on their watch, but the system requires at least a cursory review. We must make sure it is up to the times."

 IBR_Justice_Issue:0 "The Judicial Issue"
 IBR_Justice_Issue_desc:0 "If you were to look at the Iberian government, nothing better represents its horrid state than the "system" of courts around the country. The compromises made to form Iberia put the judicial system into the state it is - Portuguese cannot be tried in Spanish courts, and the reverse is true as well. Regional courts can overrule one another, leading to entire cases and trials disrupted because of some petty grievance between judges. Even worse, the federal courts have been rendered toothless, meaning that they cannot stop or even rein in the madness.\n\nWhat kind of system is this? It was created by the Caudillos, sure, but there is no way this is what they intended. Justice and the rule of law are the most important things for a functioning state, and we have neither. The Caudillos must try once more to create a solid judicial court, and this time leave nothing to chance."

 IBR_Regime_Families_desc:0 "Even though any perfect government has no factions or cliques, every regular government has plenty. We are definitely no exception. Internal factions have been a constant presence ever since both regimes were established, and they have remained through the founding of the Union. We have deemed the groups the "families" of the state, and there are many - the party itself, the army, church, and so on.\n\nEvery group has their own power and influence, and while they are all ultimately subservient to the Caudillos they can still cause incidents in the government. Even though they are non-official, it would do some good to interfere with them, ever-so-slightly. If we balanced their power, and broke up a few of the less useful cliques, it is a definite possibility that more could be squeezed out of exploiting them."

 IBR_Administration_Pyramid:0 "The Administrative Pyramid"
 IBR_Administration_Pyramid_desc:0 "The system of governance devised by the Caudillos is very peculiar. Unique might be a better word. Each province of the country is represented equally, and they are part of two constituent countries - Portugal and Spain. They are both represented equally in the Union itself, which has the final say in many regards.\n\nHowever, there are issues with the system. A lack of adequately clear provisions, as well as some uncertain edge cases, have turned the administrative system into a hydra that is more inclined to smack its heads together; a distinct lack of the harmony required to run a Union like ours. Were we to clearly define what each level can and cannot do in relation to itself and the others, we could have the country run much better."

Should you have too much, you will have a bloated monster who is only capable of profiting off its own suffering. Eventually, both will collapse in on themselves. For everyone's sakes, we cannot be either.\n\nWe are, however, the latter. When the Union was first created - the root of all evil, it seems - the compromises made led to what we have now, a bloated monstrosity that chokes the life out of everything it touches. As part of our recent governmental reforms, it would do no harm to give the bureaucracy its long-overdue audit.

As one compares the new with the old, the differences become much more drastic than they were during the drafting. An old, antiquated system made during a totally different era has been torn down. The amalgamation has been slain. In its place, a true government rises.\n\nThe compromises that created the old state are no longer. We have in essence untied a great knot, reforging the system into one Iberia, rather than two countries prepared to die on one another's arms. The Union shall face the 60's proudly, a modern state."

Even though the brow beating of the Caudillos hasn't hurt, it seems they were just as relieved to have a reformed and functional state as the Caudillos themselves. With their approval, there was only one obstacle towards ratification: the final approval stamp. It wasn't an obstacle, really, since both Franco and Salazar were simply waiting for the opportunity. With everything in order, there is only time between Iberia and its modern future.\n\nThere will never be another Battle of Barcelona, not while the Union stands with her new constitution."

Small businesses are no longer enough to supply our people's needs, and their mode of operating is inefficient and outdated. In their place we will need to reorganize suppliers on a larger scale, creating big conglomerates designed on the basis of vertically integrated supply chains and utilizing the latest technological expertise. This way our industry will be more efficient, prices will be lower, and economic development can be directed in a centralized manner. To these ends, our nation will incentivize the consolidation of industry onto a larger scale."

Yet despite these efforts, the Iberian population has always been dependent on foreign consumer goods, which are generally cheaper and better quality than what our own industry can provide. We shouldn't leave ourselves vulnerable in this manner.\n\nFor this reason we are introducing the policy of Optimized Autarky, in which we will make a renewed push towards producing civilian consumer goods on Iberian soil. It is the only way we can satisfy the people's material needs without relying on foreign industry."

Instead of revitalising our failing industries, the heavy state intervention pursued by our Falangist economic advisors has resulted in the development of a gigantic economic bubble festering like a tumour in the heart of the Iberian economy. The generous government handouts to industry were used to fuel an explosion of speculative purchasing of land and industrial assets which spiked prices while doing little to kickstart the economy. Any day now the bubble could burst, sending us all into an economic oblivion that Iberia is unlikely to survive.\n\nWe need to do something, literally anything, and we need to do it quickly. We can worry about the consequences later. We need to stop our economy from dying with whatever tactics we can think of.

Caring Iberian mothers had to cover their children's eyes when the television showed a Leonardo Vulture pecking the eye of a dead CNT member underneath the marble façade of the Sagrada Família Cathedral, and the footage of a Guardia Civil Colonel executing a handcuffed militiaman became the centerpiece of heated arguments at Sunday family lunches throughout the whole Union. Our citizens are starting to question if the State is really capable of protecting them.\n\nCaudillo Franco has made a reassuring speech explaining that the Barcelona Uprising was a complete failure and the Reds lost both the military and the political battle, but behind closed doors everyone in the regime knows that this Barcelona was only the beginning of the violence.

He may never be forgotten.\n\nAfter his passing, we've got to make sure Salazar's death doesn't cause any undue instability.

Caetano clearly has no need nor use for the bureaucratic vestiges of a dead man. Instead he looks to the future, his future more precisely with his own people. All will know that Caetano is not just some carbon copy replacement of Salazar. He is his own man, with his own ambitions. These ambitions will hopefully be delivered with this influx of new staff. Iberian political life will no doubt be impacted by these latest changes as the era of Salazar slowly fades from memory."

In order to satisfy this particular need of his new office, Caetano shall go on a grand tour of Iberia to meet the masses face to face. Some in Iberian political society have turned their noses up at the idea, seeing it as stinking of Caetano's alleged reformist mindset, but many more see it as a welcoming take on the role of Caudillo. It will certainly cause a bit of a stir and shall show off the Caudillo role for the public to gawk at, face to face.

He has, thus far, graced the office with this professionalism and has reinvigorated it with a welcoming freshness. Kicking out Salazar's cronies, and the various other stooges and lackeys that made up the crux of the office, and going on a grand tour of Iberia has certainly put Caetano in our good books. The Union looks to be strong, sturdy and stable with Franco and Caetano ruling over the nation as dual Caudillos. It is a welcoming sight to see the maintaining of the Unions stability with this choice of Caudillo now seemingly entrenched. For the greater good of Iberia, Caetano will hopefully prove himself to be a more than capable Caudillo."

Rumours of fighting, riots and looting have been thrown around but we can confirm very little for the moment. What we are not hearing though, is any sort of calm and lack of disturbance. This can only mean that some form of trouble is starting to arise at an ever-quickening pace. This trouble seems to be spiralling out of control at an uncontrollable rate, and we can only hope to get a grasp on the reality of the situation soon. For something will have to be done sharpish, before whatever situation is arising comes to a head and it becomes too late to do anything about it. If we don't keep a handle on this soon, the consequences could be truly devastating for the whole of Iberia. Containment, it seems, will soon become key.

Something must be done, that we can all agree on. The question though remains, how uncompromising shall our response be?\n\nOne side recommends we take a firm hand but not one that overdoes it. Control will be hopefully established, but our forces will not be allowed to run rampant in order to put down the insurrection by any means. In response, another side recommends going the whole 9 yards with our reaction and let the protestors know we mean business. No chances can be taken with this situation, we cannot afford to look weak in the face of a challenge such as this. Control of the situation must be established as soon as possible by any means before the protests gain enough momentum to become near unstoppable. It's a tough decision, and one that will definitely have consequences not just for Portugal but for all of Iberia."

They are partly responsible for the current crisis and thus, it is only right for us to hold them accountable. We will need to decide though, just how much we're going to hold them accountable for and how harsh we will be with our justice.\n\nOne option would be to send a message with our righteous justice that these actions will not be tolerated. It will certainly put off any other would be two-bit politician who thinks they can stand up to the Iberian Union's central government. Others though have expressed doubts as to whether this option will not have lasting ramifications that could create a deep-rooted atmosphere of future distrust and bitterness over our handling of these events. Instead, the situation could be resolved with a more forgiving hand in order to settle the situation. It may just calm the situation, but it could also be interpreted as a sign of clear weakness that the fifth column and other opportunists may pounce upon.

As people ponder what happened here and what could possibly occur again, it is our job to steer the nation through these tormenting times.

We are to call out far and wide, across the nation and across the spectrum to decide what the future will hold for Iberia.

The decision to take in public input would be drastic and will no doubt showcase a commitment for democratic reform.

Of course, it is likely that they wish to shape the discourse to make sure the military's power remains absolute yet they also make up an integral part of our movement.

The result of which could set Iberia on a path of renewal and reward in these dark times. Many are hesitant and many more are extremely nervous at the potential power shifts that these debates may cause. Indeed, no-one truly knows what the ramifications may be of this whole endeavor.

It should be our duty for this to be a true and fair process so, we are to ensure that these bad faith actors do not stop the will of the Iberian people for reform. Whatever their opinions may be, the long-standing issues that have plagued Iberia politically will hopefully be conclusively settled here. Now, the Congress is to begin.

To make sure Caetano doesn't cause trouble he will have to be convinced of the purpose of these undertakings and if need be, be pressured on so that he does not threaten the Congressional process.

These people are dinosaurs, hangers on from a time that is no longer relevant to the current situation Iberia faces.

A splintering now would be costly and something we would likely be unable to come back from. We cannot risk falling apart now at this key stage of the process.

They are the most qualified, the best for the job. If anyone were to say otherwise, then they would be clearly showing themselves off as a traitor and guilty of treason. There must be no room for disputing the greatness of our leaders, and anyone who doubts their ability must be removed."

There are a number of councilmen who were paragons of virtue, shining examples the others neglected to follow. There is no reason these dedicated men should be punished for the actions of their colleagues, and if anything they ought to be rewarded for their duties to the state. We must allow them to continue serving Iberia, and if they are incarcerated they cannot do that."

A petty nationalism still exists in place of an Iberian spirit, so until it subsides no governor shall rule over his own origin. If we let them rule over their own people, then they will place them above the Union. This must not be allowed to happen, so we will force administrators to govern regions other than their place of origin."

 IBR_new_fundemental_laws_desc:0 "Our current legislation has done us well. But we can't keep the same laws forever. The times are changing, and we require new regulations and restrictions to keep up with it. With the information from our governors, and with a totally loyal legislation, we can begin revising and drafting new laws for all of Iberia.

We have a legislature, dedicated to maintaining Iberia in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. Greatest of all, our regime is secure from any internal elements who would wish to depose us. Finally, our Union may have her calm."

 IBR_Place_Everyone_Everyone_Place_desc:0 "Even though the Council is purely advisory, each member of it have been content with their lot. Let it never be said that we are not generous - each councilman and his family will be carefully and expertly cared for in a luxurious suite complex that will cater to their every need. Of course, this all depends on them staying loyal to Iberia. To make sure they do, or at the very least as leverage for if they don't, the new residential area will allow us to keep a close watch on their loved ones. For safety's sake, of course."

 IBR_Check_Advisors:0 "Check the Council Members" 
 IBR_Check_Advisors_desc:0 "So far we have had no issues regarding the Council. There is no guarantee of how long that will last.

Who knows what damage they could inflict in such a position? There are no small number of programs and methods we could use to vet the Councilmen, and to ensure they are as truly dedicated as they claim. The more meticulous the better, so we will leave nothing in their pasts unchecked."

 IBR_Lets_Keep_Order:0 "Let's Keep Order" 
 IBR_Lets_Keep_Order_desc:0 "We value the stability of Iberia above all else. Usually the Council is a positive force for this stability - they provide insights and perspectives on issues that would otherwise go ignored. This advice can allow for laws to be better tuned, ensuring they're as efficient as possible. Sometimes, however, they have the opposite effect. Council members can at times take the impression that they are entitled to more. While dedicated, they simply do not need more to continue doing the job that they do. It's important that we make them aware of that fact."

 IBR_Fully_Functioning_Council:0 "A Fully Functioning Council" 
 IBR_Fully_Functioning_Council_desc:0 "The Councilmen know their place, and they are sufficiently loyal. Sadly, it seems we were mistaken when we estimated that our Council would be able to work fine as it is. The times are changing, and unless we change with it we will be left in the dust. We need something more functional. They must have more weight to what they say, as they are an important look into what we can improve on."

 IBR_Listen_Their_Suggestions:0 "Listen to The Council's Suggestions" 
 IBR_Listen_Their_Suggestions_desc:0 "The Council must have more weight behind what they propose. It would be impractical to even have them only to disregard everything they say seemingly for the sake of it. We ought to be more receptive to their ideas; not to say that we will agree with everything for the sake of it, but that we must recognize that, occasionally, they know what they are talking about. After all, if they are on the Council then by virtue of that alone they must have some experience to back their words."

 IBR_Listen_Regional_Government:0 "Listen To the Regional Governments" 
 IBR_Listen_Regional_Government_desc:0 "It would be wrong to leave out the regional governments of Iberia. Like the council, each region and their governments have unique perspectives and takes on the issues we face today. We could use the input of each regional government to help fine-tune coming reforms."

 IBR_Respect_Our_Differences:0 "Respect Our Differences" 
 IBR_Respect_Our_Differences_desc:0 "Every nationality in Iberia has a few 'quirks' to them. These 'quirks' can make administering them all quite difficult at times, since it can cause quite a bit of a headache trying to keep them all in line. Rather, we could devise a new system to allow the loyalty of these minorities. While autonomy is out of the question, we could still strike a mutually beneficial agreement. In exchange for loyalty and unconditional support for the Union, we could most likely look the other way in regard to some of their less harmful 'quirks'."

 IBR_Revamp_Council:0 "Revamp the Council"
 IBR_Revamp_Council_desc:0 "Now that we've laid the framework, we must now begin setting it all down in stone. We will prepare a new set of laws, guaranteeing the new position of the council and properly putting our ideas into lasting action. Drawing from the ideas of both the Council and the regional governments, once we are done the Council will be nearly unrecognizable from her previous iteration."

 IBR_Just_Dodged_Bullet_desc:0 "It is done. All over Iberia tensions are cooling, and it seems like people have just been losing the will to stay mad, for the most part. There are many dissidents in the Union still, but they will find that the people tolerate their nonsense much less. The new place of the Council seems to have soothed the worry of many, and with the promise of a bit of tolerance, many others have found newfound loyalty to the Union. We have saved Iberia from those that want to tear it apart, and all it took was modifying the role of the Council."

They argue that this will improve our diplomatic standing among the democracies of the world, in addition to solidifying the legitimacy of the elections.\n\nHowever, several council members have spoken up against this proposal, labeling it as an infringement on Iberia's national sovereignty.

Loud cries are, however, heard across the country urging the Council and the Caudillos to "ensure everyone's right to participate", with a minority of council members speaking up on their behalf.

As the days go by several larger parties seem to be taking shape, increasingly causing worry among members of the Iberian Council.\n\nOur national party which will take part in the elections, Unión Nacional, may need our help more than anticipated if these parties keep growing and consolidating their movements.

Having seen the work of the Council towards the survival of our Union, I am now confident in the value of reform. The system of government, as it stands, cannot last much longer. Despite how it pains me to say these words, I realized that stepping down is the only way forward. I have too many memories, and too much hope in the people of Iberia to let you down. I believe you have it in yourselves to lead the Union into a brighter future. Thank you for having put your trust in me."\n\n-Francisco Franco"

As a part of this we instituted a blanket embargo on trade between Iberia and the German sphere.\n\nWith Germany's economic downturn and the collapse of the Triumvirate realities have however changed. We must take a note out of Bismarck's playbook focusing on pragmatic Realpolitik. The embargo had been a necessary measure to show solidarity with the fellow Triumvirate members but in reality, it had often been broken if only secretly.

In Catalonia, it was even reported that club-wielding Falangists attempted to scare away Catalan voters! Had it not been for the Guardia Civil, who knows how widespread such incidents might have been? Similarly, more than a few radical leftists were caught red-handed, their pockets stuffed with forged and filled out ballot papers! An internal investigation, headed by a reliable prosecutor and operating with the assistance of Axencia and the police, must be carried out post-haste."

Their inexperience with democracy proved problematic when they were assigned the responsibility of managing polling stations. Councils and mayors must be roused to action and cooperate with our investigation, or else be replaced."

There are many anti-democratic groups in Iberia, both left- and right-wing, who loathe what we stand for and wish to see Iberian freedom destroyed. It would be folly to simply send out the police en masse to arrest everyone we think is responsible, however. Proper, thorough inquiries into each and every suspected group, individual and ideology must be carried out. Due process must win out over political convenience."

 IBR_protect_the_congress_desc:0 "Securing safe and free elections is the most important item on the agenda right now, but we must also look to protecting Congress itself against direct action. Iberia has a long history of political violence. Prior to and during the civil war, leftists, fascists and the military killed one another with impunity, whittling away at the foundations of the Second Republic with every death. Nobody who votes should have to worry about going back to the polls a month later because a bloodthirsty ideologue mowed down their representative in a hail of gunfire. The Caudillos made the houses of government well-suited as fortresses - let's double down, and extend the role of the Guardia Civil to protecting the physical manifestation of government."

 IBR_extend_the_vote:0 "Extend The Vote"
 IBR_extend_the_vote_desc:0 "The surest way of making election fraud more difficult, short of arresting the perpetrators, is to drown out fraudulent votes. The first election had a good turnout, but the franchise was not as broad as it should have been. The voting age of 21 is far too high, and the fact that women had to qualify at all when most other major democracies have had universal suffrage for half a century is absurd. Additionally, there are many citizens convicted of petty offences who have been forbidden to vote for life. With our majority in Congress, drafting and signing into law the legislation required to address these injustices should be no problem at all."

The Iberian people might have chosen poorly, but they knew better - as we believed they did. They made clear that they did not wish for petty division and civil strife, but rather longed for peace and justice. For years, the Caudillos insisted that democracy could not work in Iberia for so long as the threat of radicalism persisted, but the people proved them wrong. The radicalism that was so feared amounted to little more than a few misguided souls screaming into the wind of change. The Iberians were tested, and were not found wanting.

We can expect resistance from the old guard, Falangists and possibly even the conservatives of Alianza Popular. But it must be done. There have been too many families torn apart by baseless convictions; too many denied basic freedoms because they spoke out of turn; too many miniature Caudillos who grew drunk on the power they held over the people.

There will be outrage and frothing at the mouth from the right, but we must stand up for our democratic principles.

This state of affairs is unacceptable, especially given the horrifically high rates of assault, murder and suicide within prisons. Though the process will be long, painful and drawn-out, the only just solution is to go over conviction records, the judicial system and the prisons themselves with a fine-toothed comb.

This symbol of Francoist tyranny must be shut down immediately. Every single staff member will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with accordingly should they turn out to have been complicit in any criminal offence themselves, including mistreatment of prisoners. The inmates of the prison will be distributed among several smaller, more modern and humane prisons until reviews of their trials and supposed crimes are completed.

This kind of despotic claptrap will no longer be permitted - from now on, our mandate on education will be that our recent history, from the early 20th century onwards, must be taught in the most objective manner possible.

Why are so many of the wealthy bourgeoisie of our nation commissioned officers rather than bankers, businessmen, entrepreneurs and lawyers? Why is the private still paid a pittance while every second lieutenant has a house, a mistress and an Italian sports car? We must brave the lions' den and set about the military apparatus with the same rigour and decisiveness that we have applied to the bureaucracy and judicial system, lest this blatant corruption continue even in the face of renewed German aggression!"

Wrongs have been righted, justice dispensed and grievances addressed. Where once the streets were quiet and ordered, the jackboots of the over-militarised police clicking on the cobblestones, they are now filled with life. Businesses, homes and churches alike have become places of hope and happiness. Even the halls of government peal with laughter at times, as a sense of optimism unrivalled in our nation's history sets in. Above all else, there is the sense that no matter what comes, Iberia and its people will find a way to endure. No fascist, terrorist or mad dictator will halt our ascent to heights yet undreamt of! For a free Iberia, and a better tomorrow!"

The reforms within the Program are focused on protecting the wellbeing of the people most heavily affected by the crisis through increased government spending, fairer taxation, and by tackling rising inflation.\n\nIf done right, Fernández-Miranda's "New Economic Program could lead to Iberians being even better off than before.

A propaganda campaign will be launched to motivate the populace to do what they can in order to bring our consumption down to alleviate the pressures of the sudden loss of oil incurred by The Oil Crisis. By encouraging public transport, carpooling, and burning wood instead of gas, the hope is that these add up to reduce our dependence on oil.\n\nNaturally, the oil companies tell us that this will only worsen the crisis by hurting their bottom lines but it was their incompetence that placed us in this situation in the first place so they will be disregarded."

Our government cannot stand for that so the next action that needs to be taken is an expansion of our current healthcare facilities. This expansion will cover both the quantity and quality of the current healthcare system and will involve some minor nationalisation and joint public/private construction. Not only will this endear the people to our administration but will also allow people to get healthy quicker and get back to work quicker, therefore speeding up our economic recovery as well as our societal recovery."

The next step of our New Economic Program is to allocate special subsidies for public services that hire more than (include a random high number) employees.\n\nThese subsidies need to be introduced in order to make sure that our public services do not collapse in on themselves and are forced to lay off too many people.

In order to combat this sentiment, we have proposed a overhaul of the tax code, replacing our current flat income tax system with a progressive one where higher incomes are taxed at a higher rate than lower incomes. While this will be popular amongst the lower income and the more left wing in our society, we can expect an uproar amongst the highest income bracket and free market proponents but it's a measure needed to weather the storm."

Luckily, we included policies to control inflation in the N.E.P and there is no better time to introduce them. We will raise interest rates to encourage saving and slow down the immense price rises.

As part of our program, we plan to begin construction of a dam on the Tagus River which courses through Spain and Portugal. However, since this will take some time we shall also subsidise the building of wind farms in the north of the peninsula.\n\nThese will be expensive but having control over our own energy will help to ensure that the next time there is a crisis in the Middle East, we're not up the creek without a paddle."

Through this, we can make sure that even if one of our trading partners collapses because of future global recessions, we will at least have the others to fall back on.\n\nAdditionally, by having more trading ties with the world, it will speed up our own economic recovery because of the fact that it will give us access to a wider market for our exports and the opportunity for more foreign investment."

It is imperative that we do this as soon as possible to avoid defaulting on these loans and having our state debtors bail out on us.\n\nAdditionally, by paying them back, it will increase business confidence in us which allow us to pursue further loans in the future should we need to.

This means that we can relax some of the emergency measures that we put in place at the start of the crisis and things in Iberia will start to go back to normal. Our vision of brighter and fairer Iberia will soon come to fruition and the New Economic Program will be expanded and adapted to a non-crisis economy but until then we will make sure that Iberians, no matter their stature in life, have faith in their government to look out for their welfare."

The markets will sort out any resultant fallout in due course."

There is absolutely no sense in having so many economic assets under the direct supervision of government bureaucrats without the training to handle them, especially when there is no shortage of skilled and eager entrepreneurs chomping at the bit to take the burden upon themselves.

Only through plunder of the New World did Spain ascend to global dominance in the first place! Neither the autarky of the Caudillos nor the slave economy of Germany have proven viable systems; instead, the liberal nations of the world have clearly won out, demonstrating that hard work, ingenuity and economic spontaneity are the key to the enrichment of Iberia.

The Church, which was originally wary of our "plutocratic intentions" has come around to our way of thinking, and fully supports our efforts to rejuvenate Iberia. The cries of those backwards thinkers stuck in the 19th century grow ever quieter beneath the cheering of the masses at our success, and even men of the old regime offer their thanks and congratulations!

Of course, we hold no blame for this, and enough of the population voted for us that it didn't really matter at the time. Still, there were a number of rural communities and neglected municipalities - particularly in Andalusia, Galicia and Extremadura - that did not receive the same level of attention as the major population centers of the north, east and heartlands.

That said, not all Iberians are as dedicated to Catholic values as we are, and it would not do to simply ignore their complaints or pretend that we do not live in an increasingly globalised society. Divorce is an issue that continues to divide both Iberia and our party, with many considering the traditional family too important to social cohesion for us to dare infringe upon. We must decide whether to allow for a degree of secularism and permit divorce, or continue our unwavering devotion to Catholic principles. Neither option will please everyone."

The Church may be our bedrock, but it is capitalism, and the freedom to exploit it, that allows for the house to be built. While the Catholic faith ensures that all men are treated as brothers in Christ, economic and personal freedom will ensure that said men are able to make the best possible use of their lives and careers, rather than labouring under the yoke of autarky. The ordinary work of the common man is the foremost path to holiness, and so freeing him to decide for himself is an imperative.

In place of regime loyalists, the legal system will now favor highly educated and qualified individuals. It is critical that the members of the judiciary be of a high moral character, and capable of making sound judgements when a mere interpretation can decide the fate of a nation."

For all their political clout, the Caudillos never accomplished that. What we have accomplished is great in its own way; the ordinary worker, regardless of whether he wears a blue or white collar, enjoys more than just a livable wage, and we gave him that without kowtowing to trade unions or reinforcing the failing policies of autarky. For the first time, he can trust that Iberia is in the safe hands of truly competent leaders, who are willing to reform the system into one that works for all. We have yet to see how this progress will continue, but we have faith in God's favor of Iberia."

Even officials within our ranks are starting to be convinced by foolish economic policy. It is our luck that the loyal institution of Opus Dei has provided a comprehensive plan in order to emerge from these dark times.\n\nThe organization has promised that with certain stimulus arrangements the market would be able to recover and begin resuming a normal trend. In general, however, the emergency program is designed to uphold the market liberal ideology while alleviating the shock of the crisis. After all, the market has always proven itself to be most efficient at designating resources. Opus Dei have promised that opening the possibilities of exploiting new energy sources to investors, and pushing for tax cuts across the board, will bring back the forces of supply in order to meet the outstanding demand. Until then the market should be allowed to stabilise itself."

One of the most disturbing however was a one complaining about a factory in Barcelona firing most of their staff unfairly in order to uphold liquidity. This is clearly unacceptable. We cannot have companies going bust and damaging the necessary market forces we need to stave off this crisis.\n\nTo remedy this issue it has been suggested that a new work culture should be introduced, one where we can insure that firms uphold required staff numbers without paying for it with unmet variable costs. Hence, we should ensure that companies know they are supported by the government in firing unnecessary workers as long as they keep those who are truly earning their pay. This should promote productivity in the long run too."

 IBR_Audit_SegSoc_desc:0 "In the plan to restructure the economy the eyes of officials have fallen on the administration responsible for Seguridad Social. It has been recognized that social security is an important component of modern state organization, but this does not mean that just like with other government branches that it is immune to inefficiency. In line with arguments that have claimed that it only is a bottomless pit that continuously sucks money without giving back to the economy, we have decided it finally is time that we audit the whole operation. There certainly will be parts that are either not an absolute necessity or that are downright mismanaged. All these will be cut in order to save money for the government which can be used to stimulate the currently still tanking economy."

 IBR_Oil_For_Pay_desc:0 "With the ongoing oil crisis other nations have seen drastic government overreach through direct intervention to restrict oil consumption in the economy and to artificially reduce its price for state enterprises. We on the other hand will use no such draconian regulation to harm our economy. The free market has historically proven itself to be the most effective and efficient distributor of resources through the demand and supply paradigm. Hence, we should leave it to these forces to decide what happens with the oil that our nation has access to. It surely will go to those with the most need which we can identify by how much they will be willing to pay for it."

 IBR_Invest_Energy:0 "Invest in Energy"
 IBR_Invest_Energy_desc:0 "The crisis has shown us above all that oil as the sole energy source for many economic sectors cannot be relied on anymore. With any lack of energy diversification, a shock could bring great ruin. We must therefore look to other energy sources that can be exploited to ensure that our economy will be on strong foundations even when those around us are suffering. Surveys of options that we have available have produced arguments for hydroelectric power generation amongst others. It is necessary that we move quickly to restore faith in the market."
 
 IBR_Let_Market_Alone:0 "Let the Market Sort Itself Out"
 IBR_Let_Market_Alone_desc:0 "Some officials and pressure groups have come to the government to argue that direct intervention to correct market forces is essential to bring the Iberian economy out of the crisis. With great difficulty and after a number of intense debates have they been rebuked. It is clear that they have been seized by an irrational panic! Do they not know that the market is the best and only tool to correct itself? Time and time again when central authority has intervened in order to bring about what it says as good change has it resulted in terrible outcomes. On the other hand, the market has always been able to efficiently correct course and stabilise the forces of demand and supply. We must once again trust its capability; it will surely lead us out of this crisis stronger than before."

 IBR_Find_New_Markets_ML_desc:0 "Liberalising the internal market conditions has consistently been a priority for government policy due to the terrible conditions which the previous regime had left for us. However, with the advent of the oil crisis it has become clear that work needs to be done to expand our market liberal vision into the international sphere. In a similar vein to energy diversification we also must seek to expand our trading networks. Our currently weak links were damaged by the expansive economic damage that weak preparation and an incomplete restructuring of market forces had given us. Finding new markets abroad will hopefully ensure better trading capabilities in the future and ensure that future crises will not ravage our economy again."
 
 IBR_Tax_Cut_Oil_Crisis:0 "General Tax Cut"
 IBR_Tax_Cut_Oil_Crisis_desc:0 "The government has been terribly affected by the oil crisis, both in financial but also national security terms. A large factor in this is the economic downturn that domestic markets have faced. Both companies and private individuals have fewer funds than previously and hence are not spending or investing which are the important bloodlines our economy depends on. It is not for the government to sort out issues with how people interact with the market and more importantly how it functions, yet we should certainly facilitate an opportunity for the market to resuscitate itself. In this we have decided upon a general tax cut which will affect all interests in the economy. By individuals and firms having more money again we will hopefully see a return to a new normal."

 IBR_Allow_Private_Services:0 "Allow Private Services"
 IBR_Allow_Private_Services_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to influence the Iberian population and culture into accepting all tenets of free market capitalism we have never been able to really breach the bastion of support surrounding the provision of what are deemed essential public services. The crisis has however given us new impetus in our mission to finally achieve total victory over those who stand in the way of liberalising all aspects of the economy. Under the guise of returning financial stability to government expenditure it has been decided to allow private versions of public services to be authorised. With those who can afford private provisions switching we are still providing a safety net to the less advantaged strata of our society. Under current legislation the change will remain under review for a good amount of time as many are still not entirely convinced by the measure, however we are sure that the efficiency the market will display will assure them otherwise."
 
 IBR_Negotiate_Creditors:0 "Negotiate With Creditors"
 IBR_Negotiate_Creditors_desc:0 "Since the formation of the Iberian Union the new state has relied on large expenditures to ensure a semblance of external safety and internal stability in a tumultuous Europe. This has resulted in a large amount of debt now sitting square on our shoulders. With the international economy having taken a great hit many creditors have allowed panic to set in. A number of them have insisted that Iberia pay back its debts with the most utmost urgency, in some cases even with reduced interest rates. It would however currently be detrimental to our recovery were we to pay back all of the amassed debt. We hence need to find common ground with the creditors and convince them that both our parties would be better off if the debts could be delayed for a longer period of time."
 
 IBR_Thank_Later:0 ""You Will Thank Us Later""
 IBR_Thank_Later_desc:0 "The economic measures implemented on the behest of Opus Dei and with the clear approval of the administration are proving themselves to be successful by the necessary factors measured. They have however incurred the wrath of certain interest groups and some of the wider population. Describing the reforms as ruthless and amoral they have rallied against the government in protests and numerous petitions. Clearly when relying on technocratic advice it sometimes is difficult to make the public understand our intentions. Necessary sacrifices may be seen as negligence or even worse intentional evil. Like with so many things in history only hindsight will be able to clear the cobwebs from their eyes. In time they will thank us for what we done for them and those who follow. We have chosen the correct and righteous path."

 IBR_Crutial_Moment_desc:0 "We stand now at a crossroads of vital historic importance. Iberia must choose whether to embrace and effectively work with our reforms or deny their value and fall alongside other nations entirely crippled by the economic crisis. The Union has the potential to become a leading powerhouse in Europe, towering above nations with similar demographics only due to the effective management of market forces. We have done all we can for now, our response was well orchestrated and allowed the passing of necessary legislation in combating the crisis. The foundations for a strong economic upswing hence have been set. It is for Iberians to now lead the Union further into prosperity or reject the gifts we have bestowed upon them."

Decades ago, godless revolutionaries sought to tear down every moral boundary and standard in our great nation; the streets of Barcelona were filled with drunkards, hedonists and loose women! Had it not been for the moral guidance of the Caudillos and the Church, they might have spread their vile profligacy throughout the entire peninsula! This was surely the result of the secularisation and "liberation" propagated by the Popular Front and their radical allies. No such depravity shall ever find a foothold again under our watchful eye, and we must educate the nation correctly so as to ensure the same remains true under future generations."

While change may inevitably come with time, Franco's motto shall for now remain our motto, but now for the health and happiness of all Iberia, not just Spain."

 IBR_Freedom_Nation:0 "A Nation of Freedom"
 IBR_Freedom_Nation_desc:0 "Freedom to assemble, to talk, to criticise, to protest... all concessions we can make. Ruling is certainly easier when your critics are silenced (or at least muffled), but we must accept that the resumption of censorship and civic crackdowns on relatively harmless political elements will only damage the peoples' trust in our newly elected government. Democracy might have its fair share of woes, but those who claim it to be the "least worst form of government" are probably worth listening to over the more draconian Francoist old guard."

 IBR_Patriotic_Education:0 "Patriotic Education"
 IBR_Patriotic_Education_desc:0 "Without question, one of the worst crimes perpetrated by the communists, anarchists and syndicalists during the civil war was their attempt to tear down the very national identity of Spain itself! The Portuguese should be thankful that they were spared this indignity. It is clear that this improper attitude only found a foothold thanks to the vulnerabilities created in the modern mind by the overwhelming nature of modern life and the rapid rise of poorly thought-out education among the masses. Some more liberal-minded types might complain of the stuffiness and rigidity of our new education program, but instilling a strong sense of nationhood in our youth is vital to ensure the continued success of Iberia as a strong-willed and free nation of the world."

While there's no book quite so good as the Good Book, there is no shortage of great (if less relevant) literature to inspire and educate both current and future generations. We will not go down in history as a pack of book-burning fanatics like the Nazis when we can instead encourage the growth of our public libraries with more funding, literacy programs and grants for new authors. The more... old-fashioned members of our party occasionally express their dismay at the possibility of deviant or - God forbid - Marxist scribblings finding their way into the hands of our youths, but we trust that proper education will have everyone agree to relegate such trash to the dustbin of history."

After all, can a true Iberian man - much less a caballero - find the strength to be a good son, husband and father if he spends his youth with nose buried in the writings of Caesar and Cicero? It may be stimulating for the mind and for his sense of heritage, but the Iberian man is one of action! We will never abandon our ancient linguistic roots, but the boys we pass our mantle to when the time comes must be strong in both body and spirit to carry the weight of the nation on their shoulders."

 IBR_Cultural_Diversity_Protection_desc:0 "At the end of the day, we are a federation of constituent nations, not an all-encompassing juggernaut that tramples its own people. It has been this way even before the Iberian Wedding of Ferdinand and Isabella. Perhaps Franco was right to clamp down on the autonomy of the Basques and Catalans at the time of the civil war, but that time has passed. God did not make the Castilians, Leonese or Portuguese to rule alone; He made us as equals. With the political situation no longer necessitating Franco's stern measures, we can instead look to healing the divisions between the majority and minorities in our nation, and guarantee that our national brotherhood will endure any future tribulations."

Of course not! The soul of Iberia is that of ruralism, even if economic realities mean that cities and industry are the way of the future in practical terms. In the rural life, we find reflected a simpler, happier time, when the peasant whiled away the days in his fields under the responsible stewardship of his lord and the local parish. This is what we honor: the peace and respectability of the life that was for the vast majority of our history."

Initially created for solely pragmatic purposes, it has come to represent something else entirely: a great and diverse people - the IBERIAN people - who, having been divided by tribal boundaries, petty rulers, and mad ideologues for millennia, have finally come together as one family. From the plains of Andalusia to the mountains of Navarra and from the picturesque Lisbon seaside to the humming industrial towns of Catalonia, our strength and brotherhood flourishes like never before. The nations that fathered us will live on, but they are no longer all that we live for. Iberia now, Iberia forever."

Now, they say nothing - if they dare to do so, they are shouted down. Not by us, for we would never deign to engage in political brawling, but by the countless loyal supporters we find amongst the populace. What clearer mandate to govern could we possibly enjoy? Iberia, with the backing of the people and the Catholic Church, has begun its climb to heights unmatched since the days of the Armada and the empires! We have in short order accomplished within a democratic system what the Caudillos could not accomplish in nearly two decades of their joint dictatorship! A new era dawns for all of Iberia: one of peace, prosperity and, above all, stability. There can be no greater gift for our generation to leave the Iberians of the future. God bless Iberia!"

This was especially true of the radical left, which commonly organised itself along the lines of trade unions, workers' militias and village communes. It is only common sense to require any and all political groups to register as a formal political party, so that everyone can keep track of who exactly stands for what these days."

 IBR_Demilitarize_Police:0 "Demilitarize The Police"
 IBR_Demilitarize_Police_desc:0 "During the civil war, the Spanish metropolitan army proved itself either treasonous or comically inept, with only the Army of Africa being reliably capable and loyal fighters. As a consequence, Franco drastically expanded the numbers and roles of the police to maintain order amongst the ruins. Entire squads on patrol with military-grade equipment certainly put the fear of God into any recidivist reds, but they were also expensive and prone to overreacting to perceived threats. With any major unrest and secessionist movements now suppressed, such a bloated force is no longer necessary, and we can be confident that rolling back Franco and Salazar's reforms will not cause any undue problems for us in the long term."

We are loathe to continue Franco's policies, which actually seem to have encouraged a stiffening of resistance at times, but at the same time we cannot heark back to the Popular Front's policy of increased autonomy, for that would only end in disaster and the dissolution of Iberia. The matter must be put to the Cortes and the cabinet. Perhaps it may even be worth putting out feelers towards regional groups?"

 IBR_Token_Autonomy:0 "Token Autonomy"
 IBR_Token_Autonomy_desc:0 "Naturally, the matter of autonomy has already been decided. There will be no "states within states" in Iberia again. While we understand their desires, regionalists must learn to accept the reality of the Iberian Congress. If total legal equality is good enough for everyone else, it's good enough for them.

 IBR_Axencia_Expansion_desc:0 "The establishment of the Axencia was easily the wisest decision made by the Caudillos in regard to our internal security. Operating at a level the police and even the military cannot, the Axencia is both sword and shield of the state - and, by extension, the people of Iberia. Since they have not apparently made any moves against the democratic process, we feel confident in our belief that they serve the state first and foremost, rather than those in power. In light of this and their years of loyal service to Iberia, it is only fitting that the organization be expanded and its funding increased, especially as the role of the police is reduced in our renewed state."

Falangist old guard, fascists and marxists alike can all be relied on to attempt to subvert our democracy whenever the opportunity to do so presents itself. Though we have already taken the initiative and enshrined the secret ballot, we must go further. Election monitors will help prevent electoral fraud, and a new cadre of bureaucrats will ensure the electoral rolls remain clean and well-organised.

Doubtless, they always had Iberia's best interests at heart, but everyone knows what they say about Hell and good intentions. Indebted though we may be to their vigilance, we must not indulge in any whitewashing of their deeds. Nobody needs to know the gory details, but publicly accepting the realities brought about by the harsh times the Caudillos reigned over is an important first step towards building trust between ourselves and the electorate - not least because there are many former regime staff within our party."

 IBR_Rewrite_Penal_Code:0 "Rewrite the Penal Code"
 IBR_Rewrite_Penal_Code_desc:0 "Under the Caudillos, there was an aggressive approach to law enforcement at times. While we recognize the necessity of strong-arm tactics by the Axencia, the court system itself should not have such a reputation for brutality and heavy-handedness amongst the common people. The working class, especially, remains wary of them despite our promises. It would be most prudent to rewrite our nation's penal code and ensure proper judicial oversight, especially given the strong sympathy for the Caudillos amongst judges and prosecutors."

 IBR_Franco_was_Franco_desc:0 "As we have repeatedly told our critics: Yes, we are aware of everything that Franco did before, during and after the civil war. Should we renounce him merely because his actions were often unpalatable to modern sensibilities? No! His gradual easing of harsh laws and the successful return of democracy proves more than anything that he was no fascist demagogue beholden to a Bohemian corporal, but a highly pragmatic man who would go to any lengths for the sake of his beloved nation and its people. He only cracked down on genuine threats to Spanish stability, and in the case of the reds it was certainly well-deserved! Did he accept the aid of Hitler and his motley of gangsters? Yes, but who then could have forseen Germany's total conquest of Europe or the construction of Atlantropa? None should be so hasty as to judge him with the benefit of hindsight. This will be our party line, and there shall be no apologies for it."

 IBR_Renew_Catholicism_desc:0 "Even under the Caudillos, regular church attendance was far below its height in our more prosperous days. The only spike in recent years was when the German civil war erupted and the people suddenly found something rather pressing to pray about. What kind of Catholic party would we be if we failed to take advantage of our newfound legislative power by reminding the people that Iberia is, above all else, a Catholic nation? Nobody is suggesting mandatory church attendance, not only because it goes against our principles but also because it is unlikely to truly motivate the faithful. Instead, we should focus on inviting the church to play a greater role in social, welfare and educational programs. Combined with a healthy dose of funding for new religious construction (especially in the chronically godless region of Catalonia) and some well-deserved tax exemptions, we can restore Catholicism's place of pride as one of the pillars of Iberian culture and society."

That said, they are far more influential in our nation's economy than we would like them to be. We shan't go so far as to criminally probe them - that would be totally unjustified and a waste of resources. However, it would be perfectly reasonable to declare that an audit of their finances and activities is due; a simple bureaucratic review to make sure that everything is in order. While this is obviously just a sensible thing to do from a government standpoint, doing it publicly may also ease the fear common among the fascists and the godless that we are unable to treat Catholic organizations objectively."

Despite the conservative nature of the church in Spain, there is strong support among Catholic women for the earlier iterations of feminism that brought about change in more liberal nations. Our party is split on the issue along reformist and traditionalist lines. One the one hand, the Church's teachings on the structure of the family are clear, and we would not wish to give offense or act in an un-Christian manner. On the other, can we really afford to retain the idea of women acting solely in traditional roles, with a modern industrial economy and a broad sense of internationalism on the rise?"

It was the Christian vote that carried us to our first electoral victory, and it shall be the Christian vote that buoys us in future elections. This is only possible because we alone recognize what other parties do not: that Iberia and its constituent nations are, now and forever, Christian nations, bearing the heritage of nearly two thousand years on their collective shoulders.

 IBR_Tax_Increase_AP_desc:0 "In what might prove to be the most unpopular measure, at least for our own voter base, taxes will have to be raised even further then we went in our initial emergency austerity measures. Our efforts to mitigate our deficit have seen minimal success so far but both income and goods tax have to be raised or else we will have to deal with a debt crisis on top of an economic crisis.\n\nIn order to make sure that we can actually pass this policy, we will reduce corporate tax by 2% so that we can get some of the more ideological members of our party to vote on it."

In order to raise emergency funds to keep state finances afloat and cut down on bloated public spending, we will have to privatize elements of our various public services. Health, education, welfare, and even pensions will be subject to privatization schemes, opening up portions of their functions to private industry while leaving the remainder in public hands.\n\nThe public sector unions will almost certainly object, and will have to be dealt with."

Despite this, we are still overwhelmingly reliant on trade with Italy and Turkey, and it is partly this reliance which caused and exacerbated our current economic woes.\n\nIt is high time that we diversify our trade and find new trade partners, preferably ones who are not entangled in the dangerous regional politics of Europe and share our desire for free markets and democracy."

If we are to lead an economic recovery, we need to restore investor confidence. The implementation of a series of corporate tax credit schemes will make our market more attractive again, as well as calm down investors. We will also have to talk to the business associations, and assure them that we are doing everything we can to restart the economy."

The circumstances have forced us to implement a series of deeply unpopular austerity measures to shore up government revenue and prevent economic catastrophe.\n\nWe must patiently and carefully explain to the Iberian people that these sacrifices are both vitally necessary for the economic survival of the country, and represent only temporary measures that will be reversed when the crisis is over. In the meantime, we will all have to tighten our belt, grit our teeth, and wait out the crisis."

While the worst might be over, we still face a long and arduous road to recovery. Unemployment is still extremely high, and social unrest bubbles everywhere. The Marxists and separatists, mortal enemies of Iberia, will no doubt try to use this opportunity to tear down what we have built.\n\nTo calm the storm of public discontent we will have to find a new balance. Where possible, austerity must be slowly and carefully relaxed. Where necessary, a strong hand must be employed against those threatening the stability and order of Iberia."

But they never seem to learn - we are not the ones oppressing them! If anything, we are one of their closest allies. Without our strong state to protect them, they would be easy pickings for outsiders and foreigners. Their feelings must be carefully channeled to more productive pursuits than terrorism.

Just because they are present in the here and now doesn't mean they ought to be present in the future. While outright killing them is out of the question we instead need to kill their culture. While it will be a very slow process, every moment is another we can integrate the minorities.

We will show all minorities that they have only one identity, the Iberian identity.

Because we have been so strict on what is considered separatism, some separatists slip from our grasp, just because we aren't willing to look at the obvious. We need to make sure all terrorists are rightfully branded as separatists, since they clearly intend for nothing but the dissolution of the Union. Equally as bad are those who attempt to defy the will of the people, as they obviously intend to have Iberia dissolved too.

With the fair Axencia Anti-Separatista by our side we can stop every terrorist around. Sadly, they cannot yet. Why? They are not adequately equipped. They could do an even better job if we cut their need to rely on the judicial system, and train them to properly judge and prosecute who and where they see fit. Moreover, to help their performance they could likely make use of some spare military equipment to catch more separatists. "

We are free, free to act on the will of the people, free to stop anyone who doesn't.

They shaped an entire continent for the rest of time. How could this not be a great past? While we unfortunately won't be shaping a continent to our values, people seem to have begun to forget their ancestors.

Forgetfulness is just a part of being human, so what matters is reminding them. Nothing reminds people of their common bonds than a common enemy to fight.

They want to destroy the Union, if they are malicious, and if they are foolish they want to divide it into dysfunctional anarchic communes. Given the radical nature of their policies twisting them into something despicable will be child's play. This can kill two birds with one stone; we will have something to sic our propagandists on and a scapegoat for the populace.

Most are Bolshevik fronts, and those that aren't are staffed by fools who can't tell the difference between a business and an agency. It is a situation which cannot be maintained, for the good of the Union. Based on our new charges detailing the other parties as collaborating with terrorists or being separatist fronts we can either discredit or eliminate entirely any opposition to the Unión Nacional."

It is many smaller components, coming together to make a larger whole. Therefore, is it not fair to call the Union an organic state? Even more, Iberia depends on her component parts. Consider a gear in a machine; if one gear slipped out, the entire machine would fail to function. That is why we cannot let any component move out of place. There is a place for everyone, and everyone must stay in their place."

In order to avoid their shortfalls we will obviously not copy them to the letter - that would be just silly - but many of their ideas were very useful. While the time of feudalism is long dead and gone, we will never allow its execution to die out. Again, there will never be nobles and barons in the Union, but the decentralization found in feudalism will be. After all the workings of a complex organism are simple: a brain directs, but the components execute. We will let them execute."

 IBR_take_aim_at_the_fundamental_laws_desc:0 "The democratic system is good and all for legitimising what you do, but it comes with an annoying downside. You are politically accountable for what you do and the legitimacy is still simply not worth heaving to wrangle opposition. We will forever be opposed by Leftists and Bolsheviks because they are capable of manipulating the system to stay in their power. What's worse, the obsession with individual over collective has ruined the moral standards of the Union until nothing will be left but anarchy and degeneracy.\n\nThe decrepit system is incompatible with our radical reforms. Democracy is nothing but a sham used by Leftists to seize power against the will of the people. The system needs to go, for the good of Iberia. Equally so, anyone who objects must be shut down and silenced. It will take a long time to fully dismantle these shams, but it will be time well spent. The only concern is that the people will, brainwashed as they are, reject these reforms out of stubbornness. They will all come around in time."

Faithful Catholics one and all, farmers and ranchers are the true examples of the proper organic components. Tireless work to improve the whole, and they know the importance of their place. Even at the expense of others these rural heroes ought to be rewarded for their dedication. If we show the benefits of just working with us then more will follow along and co-operate."

With the acceptance of the people we can begin moving the balance of power. Even despite their best efforts people simply just don't know what's best for them. The ability to decide will be moved away from them and to experts, who understand how to give everyone exactly what they need.

Only one step remains until we can take on the legacy of the Caudillos.\n\nWe will proclaim O Estado Novo - the new state.

Even the regime's great idea of falsely opening up to allow greater liberties has been spotted by the population and they have risen against it, demanding real freedom. Now that the old government is no more and a transitional government has been assembled to transform Iberia into a true democracy, the revolution that began in the streets will see its end in the actions this new government will take to free Iberia from the yoke of tyrants."

With the dictatorship gone, it is now time to fully disband the party and its organizations to make sure the people are free. The new government will also make sure that all the top members and ideologues, that have plagued the minds of the Iberian people for years with toxic opinions and believes, are found, arrested and made sure that never they never again hold political positions."

Most of the top generals and admirals supported the dictatorship and they saw it as a way of obtaining profit without much effort and in the worst cases they agreed with its ideology. Most of them didn't react soon enough to the revolution and are incarcerated; while those that were able to gather supporters to rise against the people's will were swiftly defeated and now share cells with their partners. We must make sure that these people are never again in positions of power in the military to avoid possible plots and coup attempts and as such they all will be fired from their positions and will await their fate in prison where they can't hurt anyone."

With the old regime gone, this group have pledged to support our cause of liberty, but they have their reservations. With socialists now allowed to rally and publish their newspaper the conservatives have sent the government their concerns over what they call "barbaric socialists".

Of course, we can't ban them again, otherwise we would become what we have sworn to destroy.

There is no reason to think that this style of governance will not continue to work in the future.\n\nSome call our system of government despotic, but they care little for the security and survival of the Iberian people.

To have factions within the government and respected Iberian institutions also criticizing government policy has become an increasingly tiresome nuisance.\n\nAs much as they proclaim their loyalty to the regime, their incessant whining weakens us and suggests to the people that there is disunity within the Union.

The only way we can stop this disturbing trend is to give the Axencia the ability to work better with less, and even better with more. Any corrupt officials will be removed from their posts, the rest will be evaluated for their loyalty to ensure they don't have sympathies they shouldn't.

The structure of our nation has nothing to do with that, and it shall not change. In fact, efforts must be redoubled to maintain it!

There is no greater glory for a wife than to give life to a new generation of good, strong Iberian boys and girls - the shapers of the future and the bearers of our dreams.

Even the Caudillos would admit that the men who keep Iberia safe and strong would be nothing without the fairer sex to bear their spirits aloft, endure the trials of childbirth and keep their homes from falling into chaos and disrepair.

Every regional minority in the peninsula is now represented in government, allowed a token degree of administrative self-management and is no longer subject to systemic repression.

One of these goals that they have in mind is a new kind of regional autonomy, wherein minorities would be guaranteed core rights such as the use of their languages and the freedom to celebrate their traditions. At the same time, they would not be granted any kind of administrative autonomy. In effect, the regional governments would be run BY the people, but FOR the state.

If we wait too long, then our Italian rivals may be able to get the upper hand. In order to avoid this great tragedy, emergency meetings between the Caudillos of Iberia and the top echelons of the Iberian military will need to be arranged post haste.\n\nThe reasoning behind these meetings are simple. Plans need to be arranged, and rather quickly, in order to gage how best to handle the ever-growing situation in Algeria. If something isn't agreed upon quickly then the opportunity provided to us will slip from our grasp. But we shall fear not, for our top men are on the case to come up with a solution for the Algerian problem."

General Kaúlza has come up with quite the plan to tackle the Algerian conundrum and has managed to convince both the top brass and the Iberian political elite that his formula for Iberian domination in Algeria is foolproof.\n\nThe generals plan involves the following steps. The first step is an embarking of covert operations in the region, following along a strategy of tension that will help the settlers see the benefits of Iberian rule over the entirety of the region. The next step is to arm the (mostly Portuguese) settlers that inhabit Algeria and train them in the proper self defence stylings in order to stave off any would-be settler killer that dare strike out at our citizens. The final step is a surprise attack that will knock out our enemies quickly with such vigor, they won't even know what hit them. It's truly a great plan from General Kaúlza that we hope to replicate with great precision and ability."

The mostly Portuguese settlers are amongst our most rabidly loyal citizens, and are deeply committed to the Iberian dream and all of its colonial ambitions. To take on the white man's burden with such tenacity is surely something to behold.\n\nWe will need to back their idealism in the form of guns and training programs, to make sure they are properly equipped with the skills necessary to take on the Italians and their barbarian allies. However, once the settlers are equipped with the training of our most capable officers and our most modern military equipment, then they shall be turned into a truly unstoppable force."

It helps to keep up appearances these days and a certain level of plausible deniability cannot go amiss.

Thus, it's time to set some proper planning into motion and get ready for the coming war.\n\nIn order to properly gain the advantage in terms of equipment over enemy forces, we have come up with a remarkable plan. Shedloads of military equipment and high-grade weaponry will be sent by plane over to Oran. Through this method, we can really start to set up the infrastructure that can handle an all-out war in the future."

In order to become ready and set up the commandos shall land in Algeria, ready and prepared to inflict proper damage to the enemy.

It is of great importance that the Italians cannot know of these preparations or we shall lose the great advantage of a surprise attack.

Salazar himself insisted on naming the operation after the famed Portuguese explorer Dom Henrique, in order to honor the Portuguese settlers who have become an intrinsic part of the operation. Franco, though, has also insisted on having him referred to by the Spanish title of "Don". No doubt showing that some friendly rivalry is still alive back in Iberia.\n\nIt matters little though, for our forces are here to do one thing and one thing only: Take out the enemy in one fell swoop, thus securing Algeria all for ourselves.

Moreira's plan has managed to win out in the proceedings and has been given the all clear by the Caudillos as the best way to solve the Algerian situation.\n\nMoreira's plan involves easing tensions in the region in order to avoid a conflict and the inevitable drain on manpower and resources that the war would cause. Instead, an olive branch will be extended to Italy with the goal of joint partnership in Algeria. It will be a tough road ahead and there will be compromises but hopefully, we shall not be bogged down in any long land war in the region.

The settlers have been flexing their position recently and if any hint of uprooting their positions came about, then they would no doubt kick up an unignorable fuss.\n\nWe don't need the Algerian negotiations to stir up tensions back home so this is a position we will need to stand firm on. We're sure the Italians will understand this though. They have their own "white man's burden" in the continent that requires there to be a European settler presence in the region.

Something big, no doubt. A ministerial position, and an important one at that, will have to be considered.

We will guide them to true civilisation just as we always have and they shall be all the more grateful for it.

We will need to hash out some kind of terms before the ENI decides upon something without our consent.\n\nMattei would be a fool not to strike some kind of deal with ourselves. We all know it is in all of our best interests to share the oil wealth of this very prosperous land. The natives certainly wouldn't know what to do with it.

It will likely be where it is decided whether this plan can go ahead, or is dead in the water.\n\nThe distrust in the air between the diplomats is palpable. Even after all this time, it is clear the two nations do not trust each other. So much has happened over a short period of time recently. In times as war heavy and as chaotic as these, opportunists arise and this case is no different.

We have had no definite response though, and this is making some of the more worrisome members of Iberian pollical society tear their hair out.\n\nIn the end, it is down to the Italians and all we can do now is wait for their response. We won't have to wait long though, for a decision is sure to come reasonably sharpish. Let us all hope that these talks were not all for nought and that something good can come of this whole endeavor.

The best way to get the attention of the United States is to give them some help in very important places.

The island is in a location of immense tactical value, able to serve as a dock for ships and a point through which to filter supplies. It is for these reasons that the Americans want to use it.\n\nAs a gesture of goodwill, we can effectively rent out the island to them, and allow them to use it as they please - so long as it is given back to us in fair shape.

The heart wrenching stories of those who have truly lost everything have made a very strong case to the government.\n\nTherefore, it is about time they got their revenge. If the Portuguese shall not have it, then the Germans assuredly won't either. Even though they seemingly took everything, there is something very important they failed to take.

One of the first things the settlers did was teach the inhabitants Portuguese, in order to better communicate with the natives. Portugese language is by no means universal, but a significant enough number of Africans in the former colonies know the language to make alternative operations practical.\n\nWe will deploy forces able to use the power of song and voice to strike fear into the Africans fighting under German command, turning their traditions and customs against them.
