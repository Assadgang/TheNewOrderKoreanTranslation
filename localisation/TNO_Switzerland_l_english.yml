 #Ideas
 
 SWI_fortress_switzerland:0 "스위스 요새"
 SWI_fortress_switzerland_desc:0 "Switzerland, for nearly a hundred years, has maintained a policy of armed neutrality. Surrounded by enemies eager for a slice of the Swiss pie, it has armed itself to the teeth and built fortresses, bunkers, and bases in every corner of the nation. In the case of war, the National Redoubt comes into play, in which the entire nation is mobilized to fight a grueling guerilla war, with the capability to do so for decades. Each man serves mandatory service. The mountain state is ready for war at a moment's notice."
 SWI_the_cash_must_flow:0 "넘쳐흐르는 현금"
 SWI_the_cash_must_flow_desc:0 "As Switzerland is a neutral nation, it does not hesitate to trade with nations that may be at ends with each other. While saving German gold, it makes chocolate for America and makes Swiss watches for the rich in Japan. Rich in the face of superpowers who would rather see it destitute, Switzerland prevails in scrounging out as much cash as it can, and this does not seem to be changing anytime soon. As countless slaves toil around the world, Helvetia is booming."
